## Hello, welcome to my Github profile!

[My Twitter](https://twitter.com/ADustyOldMuffin) - [My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-h-10697587/) - [My Itch.io](https://adustyoldmuffin.itch.io/)

I'm a software engineer currently working at a company called PDI where I work on software for the wholesale fuel industry. I love what I do and it's my passion. Astronomy, outer space, and the pursuit of knowledge are also things that I enjoy as well as my many side projects I work on to learn new technology. 

<br />

I enjoy my work the most when I believe in what I'm doing and that what I'm doing is making a difference to someone which is why I enjoy learning and trying to improve open source projects like [Github Desktop](https://github.com/desktop/desktop) or the [.NET Project](https://github.com/dotnet?type=source).
